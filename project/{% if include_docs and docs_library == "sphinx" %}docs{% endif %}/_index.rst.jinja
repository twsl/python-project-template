Dev Guide - Getting Started
---------------------------

Before installing any dependencies or writing code, it's a great idea to create a
virtual environment. `conda` is often used to manage virtual
environments. If you have conda installed locally, you can run the following to
create and activate a new environment.

.. code-block:: console

   >> conda create env -n <env_name> python={{ python_version }}
   >> conda activate <env_name>


Once you have created a new environment, you can install this project for local
development using the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   >> poetry install
   >> {% if use_precommit %}pre-commit install && pre-commit autoupdate{% endif %}
   >> {% if include_notebooks %}po{% endif %}


Notes:

1) The single quotes around ``'[dev]'`` may not be required for your operating system.
2) ``pre-commit install`` will initialize pre-commit for this local repository, so
   that a set of tests will be run prior to completing a local commit.
3) Installing ``pandoc`` allows you to verify that automatic rendering of Jupyter notebooks
   into documentation for ReadTheDocs works as expected.
